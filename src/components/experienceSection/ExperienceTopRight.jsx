        During my tenure at <span className="font-bold text-orange">PWC</span>,
        I contributed to the development of dynamic and responsive user
        interfaces, adhering to best practices for scalability, performance, and
        maintainability. I built Single Page Applications (SPAs) using{" "}
        <span className="font-bold text-orange">
          React, Redux, React Router, and Hooks
        </span>
        , following a component-based architecture and implementing reusable UI
        components across projects.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm text-center text-white mb-4">
        On the backend, I developed and maintained RESTful APIs using{" "}
        <span className="font-bold text-orange">
          Node.js, Express, and MongoDB
        </span>
        , implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, and
        optimizing data handling for high-traffic applications.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm text-center text-white mb-4">
        I was also involved in cloud infrastructure and deployment tasks,
        managing CI/CD pipelines and deploying applications to{" "}
        <span className="font-bold text-orange">AWS</span> services like EC2,
        S3, and Lambda. I containerized applications using{" "}
        <span className="font-bold text-orange">Docker</span>, enabling
        consistent development and deployment environments.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm text-center text-white mb-4">
        In addition to JavaScript technologies, I have worked with{" "}
        <span className="font-bold text-orange">Python</span> for automation and
        scripting tasks, and developed backend services and APIs using{" "}
        <span className="font-bold text-orange">PHP</span>, particularly in
        legacy systems and CMS platforms.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm text-center text-white">
        My role required cross-functional collaboration with designers, DevOps,
        and QA teams to ensure end-to-end project success. I consistently
        focused on writing clean, modular, and testable code, while staying up
        to date with modern development workflows and technologies.
